# HTML Foundations

When we author HTML documents, the main goal that we should have in mind is not the visual
representation of the result (that's the role of CSS), but rather the conveying of the meaning
of the content we are creating. First of all we have to think of the readers of the HTML we are
writing. And these readers are _User Agents_.

The User Agent acts on behalf of the user, and the HTML we author must be understandable for the
user agent in order for it to be able to present it to the user in the right way.
User agent might be for example:

- a web browser
- a screen reader (that's why accessibility really matters)
- web scraper, e.g. LLM (and maybe we might want to prevent such tools from having an easy access to
  our website)
