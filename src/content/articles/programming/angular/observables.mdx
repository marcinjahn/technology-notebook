# Observables in Angular

Observables are pretty similar to .NET's Events. The `Observable<T>` is a stream
of data that we can `subscribe()` to to get the latest values. This
functionality comes with the [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) package.

An `Observable<T>` might deliver 3 kinds of messages:

- data of type `T`
- error
- completion - signifies that this `Observable` will not deliver any more data

Observables can be finite, meaning the stream of data will eventually finish and
the observer(s) will be notified about that (HTTP request is an example of such
an Observable). Observables might also be infinite and the completion will
never occur.

:::tip[$ Postfix]
In Angular, there is an unofficial convention to postfix variables representing
`Observable<T>` with a **$** sign. Additionally, often the last value of the
observable is stored in a variable called the same as the one holding the
`Observable<T>`, but without the "$" sign this time.

```ts
temperature$: Observable<number>;
temperature: number; // last value of temperature$
```

:::

## Built-in Observables

RxJS comes with a few built-in functions that create observables:

- `interval` - works similarly to JS's `setInterval`. We set the interval in
  milliseconds, incoming values are incresing, like in a counter (starting from
  0).
- `create` - we're given a function where values emitted by the new observables
  need to ne "manually" pushed out (example is below).
- [and a few more...](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/creation)

## Custom Observables

Here's how we can create our own Observables. This is a custom `interval`
implementation:

```ts
let customInterval = Observable.create(observer => {
    let i = 0;
    setInterval(() => {
        observer.next(i++);
    }, 1000);
})

const sub = customInterval.subscribe(value => {
    console.log(value);
}

sub.unsubscribe();
```

## Operations

### Removing Subscription

Subscriptions stay for as long as the app lives. If we are no longer interested
in receiving values, we should explicitly remove the subscription. Otherwise,
we'd have a memory leak.

```ts
// Create a subscrition
const subscription: Subscription = interval(1000).subscribe((value) =>
  console.log(value),
);

// Remove the subscription
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

In Angular, most often we will want to remove the subscription when some
component is no longer displayed. In such case, the component should implement
`OnDestroy`, which comes with the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook. We should remove
subscription there.

:::tip[Router]
Angular's [Router](/programming/angular/routing) allows us to subscribe to
various observables (e.g. `params`). Exceptionally, we don't need to unsubscribe
from them, because Angular will do that for us in the background. Using
`unsubscribe()` does not cause any harm though.

[HttpClient](/programming/angular/http) has similar characteristics.
:::

### Error handling

Subscription can have have an error. For example, when doing an HTTP request. In
such a case the subscription "dies" and we do not have to call `unsubscribe()`
on it.

We can also handle errors by providing error handler as a second argument to
`subscribe()`.

```ts
const sub = someObservable.subsctibe(
  (value) => console.log(value),
  (error) => console.log(error),
);
```

Without handling errors explicitly, Observable will throw the error to the
console.

### catchError

We can also use the `catchError` [operator](#operators). We can attach it once
to some observable, to include some common error handling logic. We can rethrow
an error from withing that operator with `throwError(...)`. Then, each
subscriber may handle the rethrown error individually.

```ts
const observable = someObservable.catchError((e) => {
  // log the error or whatever..
  throwError(e);
});

const sub1 = observable.subscribe(
  (n) => {
    // do somehting...
  },
  (error) => {
    // handle rethrown error...
  },
);

const sub2 = observable.subscribe((n) => {
  // do something, and hope it will not fail...
});
```

Like the example above shows, the individual subscribers can still attach their
own error handling logic. The "common" handler will always be fired first, and
then the error will be propagated to the subscribers.

### Completion

Observables can be finite. Here's how we can complete custom observables:

```ts {7}
let customInterval = Observable.crete((observer) => {
  let i = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    observer.next(i++);

    if (i >= 5) {
      observer.complete();
    }
  }, 1000);
});
```

Subscribers can be notified about completion via a third argument to the
`subscribe()` method:

```ts
const sub = someObservable.subsctibe(
  (value) => console.log(value),
  (error) => console.log(error),
  () => console.log("COMPLETE"),
);
```

We don't need to `unsubscribe()` from completed subscriptions.

:::caution[Error]
In cases when subscription throws an error, completion will never occur.
:::

## Operators

We might want to somehow change the behaviour of some subscription. For example,
we might want to filter out some values, or maybe transform them into some other
data. This is where the **Operators** come in. They allow us to create new
Observables based on existing ones.

Here's an example:

```ts
const originalObservable = interval(1000);

const modifiedObservable = originalObservable
    .pipe(map(value: number => value + 1));

modifiedObservable.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
```

We apply operators with the `pipe()` function. We used the `map` operator. There
are lots more in the `rxjs/operators` import. For example:

- `filter` rejects values that do not conform to the provided predicate;
- `catchError` allows to handle error "globally" somehow and `throwError`
  (possible a new one) down the chain
- `take` - automatically completes the resulting `Observable` after receiving
  `n` items from it. We do not need to `unsubscribe()` from it, it will be
  handled automatically. It is useful when we want to get just one latest value
  of some `Observable` (like the `BehaviorSubject` described down below).
- `switchMap` similar to `map`, but accepts function that crosses boundaries (more on that in the _tip_ below)

### Maps

There's a nice overview of different kids of maps, like `map`, `mergeMap`,
`switchMap` at
[Medium](https://luukgruijs.medium.com/understanding-rxjs-map-mergemap-switchmap-and-concatmap-833fc1fb09ff).

:::tip[switchMap]
An `Observable<T>` could be treated as a
[functor](/programming/functional-programming/fundamentals#functors) and a
[monad](/programming/functional-programming/fundamentals#monads).

The `map` operator is like a `Map` on a functor. It turns `Observable<T>` into
`Observable<U>` by accepting a function that turns a _regular value_ `T` into a
regular value `U`.

The `exhaustMap` operator is like a `Bind` on a monad. It turns `Observable<T>`
into `Observable<U>` by accepting a function that turns a regular value `T`
into an _elevated value_ - `Observable<U>`.
:::

:::tip[Chaining]
To chain a few operators sequentially, we can call `pipe()` multiple times, or
we can provide more operators as next arguments to `pipe()`.
:::

## Subject

Rxjs comes with a special type of Observable - **Subject**. It is functionally
very similar to Angular's `EventEmitter<T>`. Reportedly, it's more performant
though and it's recommended to always use **Subject**.

:::caution[outputs]
`EventEmitter<T>` is still needed when we're dealing with outputs! `Subjects`
are usable only when we control both the producer and the consumer sides.
:::

```ts
const mySubject = new Subject<number>();

// Emit
mySubject.next(5);

// Subscribe
const sub = mySubject.subscribe((value) => {
  // do something...
});

//Unsubscribe
sub.unsubscribe();
```

:::tip[Operators]
We can use [operators](#operators) on `Subjects`, we can't do that with
`EventEmitter`.
:::

:::tip[BehaviorSubject]
There's also another variant of `Subject` called `BehaviorSubject`. It comes
with an additional feature - the subscriber is always able to read the last
value of the Subject, even if it subscribes after that value was published.
It needs to be initialized via constructor with some initial value.
:::

## Combining Observables

In some cases we might need to use values from multiple observables to create
some new value. It is often used in [ngRx effects](/programming/angular/ngRx/).

RxJs offers a few ways to combine observables. Some of these are operators, and
some are functions that allow us to create new Observables, based on the ones we
provide.

:::caution[ngRx selectors]
In [NgRx](/programming/angular/ngrx/), our state often has some initial default values (often `null`
or `undefined`). These are counted as "emitted values", meaning that the
operators/function below will ues them to produce the output. It might make
sense to skip these initial values with some operator like `skipWhile(n => !n)`.
:::

### Operators

#### withLatestFrom

<Image src={withLatestFrom} alt="RxJS withLatestFrom operator visualized" />

It will publish only at points of time when the first observable emits. The
first output will come out only after all of the provided observables have
emitted at least one value.

####

#### combineLatestWith

<Image
  src={combineLatestWith}
  alt="RxJS combineLatestWith operator visualized"
/>

It's pretty similar to `withLatestFrom`. The difference is that the output is
emitted when any of the input observables emits something, the first observable
is not prioritized in any way.

:::caution[combineLatest]
There is also a [combineLatest](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/combineLatest)
operator, which is pretty similar to `combineLatestWith`, but it's **deprecated**.
:::

There also is a
[combineLatest](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/combineLatest) function (not
the same as the deprecated operator!) that behaves pretty similar to the
`combineLatestWith` operator, and it may be used to create observables from
other observables. The difference is that operator fires when the source
observable emits, while the function like
[combineLatest](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/combineLatest) (not an
operator) creates an observable, that one can subscribe to, and only then it
will produce values.
