# Services and Dependency Injection

Angular has a bit of similarity to the .NET ecosystem in regards to handling
services. The classes that provide some specific functionalities (like logging)
can be brought into other classes (e.g. components) using Dependency Injection.
Here's a simple example:

```ts title="Service"
export class LoggerService {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}
```

```ts title="Component" {3,6,9}
@Component({
    ...,
    providers: [LoggerService]
})
export class MyComponent {
   private readonly logger = inject(Logger);

    someMethod() {
        this.logger.log('Something happened');
    }
}
```

The highlighted lines show, in order:

1. How to create a _scope_ for `LoggerService`
2. Injection of the service.
3. Using the injected service.

:::tip[File Naming]
Just like other kinds of entities in Angular, files containing services
are usually named following the template of `<name>.service.ts`.
:::

:::tip[inject]
We can also inject services with the constructor:

```ts
import { inject } from "@angular/core";

export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private readonly logger: Logger) {}

  someMethod() {
    this.logger.log("Something happened");
  }
}
```

:::

Services in Angular are just typical TypeScript classes. They do not use any
Angular-specific decorator (unless you want to [inject it into some other
service](#injecting-into-services)).

## Scope

The way how we injected the service into the component in the example above has
some consequences:

- the child components (direct and indirect) will receive the same instance of
  the `LoggerService` (if they ask for it)
- all the other components (other than the children of `MyComponent`) would
  receive different instance(s) of `LoggerService`

The Angular injector is _hierarchical_. We can inject services into:

- components - `providers` of a module or component
- services - `providers` of a module and `@Injectable`
- directives
- pipes

### Singleton

Providing a service via `SomeComponent` makes it a singleton among the children
tree of that component.

Providing a service via the `AppComponent` makes it a singleton among all
components (since `AppComponent` is usually the root of any Angular app).

Providing a service in ANY [eager-loaded module](/programming/angular/modules#lazy-loading)
(e.g., `AppModule`), makes it a **global singleton** (for both all the components
and services). T

Providing a service in a [lazy-loaded module](/programming/angular/modules#lazy-loading), makes
that service available in entities declared within that module only. If some
service is provided both globally and in lazy-loaded module, the lazy-loaded
module (and its entities) will get its own instance of that service.

:::tip
We can also decide that some service should be a singleton on this service's
level via the `@Injectable({provideIn: 'root'})` decorator. Then, we don't have
to put it in any `providers` array.

This method cannot be used with [interceptors](/programming/angular/http#interceptors).
They have to be provided in a module.
:::

The way how Angular sets up DI is different from the .NET's way of doing that.
In .NET we decide whether the service should be a singleton or not at the
application root level. In Angular, each class/component may decide whether it
wants to reuse some service instance or to get a new one.

:::caution[Overriding]
An instance of the service being injected (according to the rules above) may be
overridden by a different instance of that service if we decide to `provide` it
again.

The class that requires some service, but does not `provide` it, will receive
the instance that was provided up in the tree (assuming that it was provided
there).
:::

## Injecting into Services

Services may be injected into other services. Services do not use decorators by
default, so there is no `providers` array. Instead, services that want to have
some dependency injected, need to use the special `@Injectable` decorator.

Here's an example:

```ts
@Injectable()
export class DataService {
    private readonly logger = inject(Logger);

    doSomething: Promise<Something> {
        this.logger.log("Doing something");
    }
}
```

Angular will try to match all the dependencies that are required by the
class with DI. In this case, `Logger` would be injected.

:::caution
In order for a service to be injectable, it has to be `provided` in some module
or the decorator should be used like this: `@Injectable(provideIn: 'root')`
(there are other `provideIn` options as well).
:::

## Provide Strategies

Until now, in the module's `providers` array, we'd just list the names of the
services. By default, the class's name acts as a token that represents that
class. Angular's injector is more flexible and we can define a token and
dependency to be different things. It's a bit similar to how in .NET there's an
interface that classes depend on and a class that actually implements that
interface and gets injected.

Providers can be also defined like this:

```ts
...
providers: [
    // Create MyClass and inject in place of SomeToken
    { provide: SomeToken, useClass: MyClass },

    // Inject whatever AnotherToken resolves to in place of SomeToken
    { provide: SomeToken, useExisting: AnotherToken },

    // Returns a static value in place of SomeToken
    { provide: SomeToken, useValue: "abc" },

    // Define a function that returns something in place of SomeToken
    {
        provide: SomeToken,
        useFactory: () => something,
        deps: [ ] // tokens to be used by the factory if it has some parameters to be injected
    },
],
```

The factory injection function can be defined in a separate file, often called
`<service>.service.provider.ts`.

:::tip[Default]
The default `providers: [SomeService]` shorthand can be treated as:

```ts
providers: [
    { provide: SomeService, useClass: SomeService }
],
```

:::

### Tokens

The injection tokens are recommended to be created like this:

```ts
import { InjectionToken } from "@angular/core";

export const APP_CONFIG = new InjectionToken<AppConfig>("app.config");

// and provide...

providers: [{ provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: { a: "b" } }];
```

:::caution[Interfaces]
Even though TypeScript has interfaces, and it would seem that they could be the
perfect injection tokens, we can't use them, because interfaces disappear during
the transpilation process.
