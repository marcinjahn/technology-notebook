# CSS Foundations

This is a kind of vocabulary listing explaining the most fundamental (or a bit more specific) CSS
concepts

## Cascade

It's the first "C" in the CSS. It's not about inheritance (inheritance is a separate concept of
CSS). Cascade is about resolving conflicts in our stylesheets (or actually not only ours, because
User Agent (UA) stylesheets are also considered). Cascade is an ordered list of style sheets. They all
get combined and conflicts get resolved automatically. Various primitives may influence the ordering
and conflict resolution:

- `!important` - prioritizes rules. UA rules that are `!important` take precedence over author
  `!important` declarations. The use of `!important` is really valid only when you do not have
  control over the entire style sheet. Otherwise, it shows potential issues in your CSS design.
- specificity - Specificity has 3 values, which get combined into a 3-digit number. The higher the
  number, the higher the specificity (and priority of the rule). `:where` might be used to avoid
  specificity.
- `@layer` - allows to explicity specify the order of various style sheets, including imported ones.

## Imports

Imports work as if you just copied and pasted the contents of imported file in place of the `@import` declaration.

## Inheritance

In CSS, various properties get inherited by children elements. Not all properties work this way.
You can find out if a given property is inheritable in the CSS specs (e.g.
[text-indent](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/text.html#propdef-text-indent) is not inheritable) We can make any property inheritable by using `inherit` value for such property (it will inherit
from direct parent only though).

## Pseudo

**Pseudo-classes** are selectors that use information inferred from the document, and not just the authored markup itself.
E.g., it could information whether some element is `hovered`.

### :is

`:is()` pseudo-class allows us to group specifiers.

Example:

```css
:is(ul, ol) li
```

This is the same as:

```css
ul li, ol li
```

This avoids some repetition.

**Pseudo-elements** are elements that are not defined explicitly in the document, but they do exist
and we might want to select them. Example is `::first-letter`.

## Engines

Web engines look at the selectors from right to left. Each time tehy move to the left they filter.
So, in general, the right-most part should be the most limiting for efficiency.

`ul *` is worse than `*` in terms of performance for example (these are not equivalent markups, it's
just an example).

## Box Model

Box Model is the Visual Formatting Model (VFM) of CSS. CSS operates on boxes that it creates layout
from.

### Intrinsic Size

It's a size of element calculated based on its content, not on explicit size specification.

## Reference Pixel

1 px = 1.96 inch. In CSS, we do not deal with real pixels, but rather with these reference pixels.

`em` is a relative unit. `n em` means: whatever px size we'd normally get for this element, multiply
it by n. `rem` is simpler - it just scales against the root element of the page.

## Auto

Various CSS properties accept `auto` as a value. It has different meaning for different properties,
so it's best to check in the specs what it means for a given property.
