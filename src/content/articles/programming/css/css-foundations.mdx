# CSS Foundations

This is a kind of vocabulary listing explaining the most fundamental (or a bit more specific) CSS
concepts

## Cascade

It's the first "C" in the CSS. It's not about inheritance (inheritance is a separate concept of
CSS). Cascade is about resolving conflicts in our stylesheets (or actually not only ours, because
User Agent (UA) stylesheets are also considered). Cascade is an ordered list of style sheets. They all
get combined and conflicts get resolved automatically. Various primitives may influence the ordering
and conflict resolution:

- `!important` - prioritizes rules. UA rules that are `!important` take precedence over author
  `!important` declarations. The use of `!important` is really valid only when you do not have
  control over the entire style sheet. Otherwise, it shows potential issues in your CSS design.
- specificity - Specificity has 3 values, which get combined into a 3-digit number. The higher the
  number, the higher the specificity (and priority of the rule). `:where` might be used to avoid
  specificity.
- `@layer` - allows to explicity specify the order of various style sheets, including imported ones.

## Imports

Imports work as if you just copied and pasted the contents of imported file in place of the `@import` declaration.
Frameworks that compile down to CSS, like SCSS have different primitives for importing, like `@use`.

## Inheritance

In CSS, various properties get inherited by children elements. Not all properties work this way.
You can find out if a given property is inheritable in the CSS specs (e.g.
[text-indent](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/text.html#propdef-text-indent) is not inheritable) We can make any property inheritable by using `inherit` value for such property (it will inherit
from direct parent only though).

## Pseudo

**Pseudo-classes** are selectors that use information inferred from the document, and not just the authored markup itself.
E.g., it could information whether some element is `hovered`.

### :is

`:is()` pseudo-class allows us to group specifiers.

Example:

```css
:is(ul, ol) li
```

This is the same as:

```css
ul li, ol li
```

This avoids some repetition.

**Pseudo-elements** are elements that are not defined explicitly in the document, but they do exist
and we might want to select them. Example is `::first-letter`.

## Engines

Web engines look at the selectors from right to left. Each time they move to the left they filter.
So, in general, the right-most part should be the most limiting for efficiency.

`ul *` is worse than `*` in terms of performance for example (these are not equivalent markups, it's
just an example).

## Box Model

Box Model is the Visual Formatting Model (VFM) of CSS. CSS operates on boxes that it creates layout
from.

### Intrinsic Size

It's a size of element calculated based on its content, not on explicit size specification.

### Box Sizing

By deafult, `box-sizing` seaprates `width`, `padding` and `border`. Setting `width` sets it only on
the content alone. `box-sizing: border-box` changes that, and it is a popular setting to
use.

## Reference Pixel and Relative Units

1 px = 1.96 inch. In CSS, we do not deal with real pixels, but rather with these reference pixels.

`em` is a relative unit. `n em` means: whatever px size we'd normally get for this element, multiply
it by n. `rem` is simpler - it just scales against the root element font size of the page.

## Auto

Various CSS properties accept `auto` as a value. It has different meaning for different properties,
so it's best to check in the specs what it means for a given property.

## Flow

When we talk about flow of elements in CSS, we mostly talk about the `display` proprty. Different
values of this property decide how elements flow in the box model of CSS. The `display` property
decides how children of the element are laid out - it's the _inner display type_. At the same time,
it sets the _outer display type_ as well, that is how this element behaves in relation to the boxes
around it.

```css
/* Full format */
<ELEMENT > {
  display: <outer> <innter>;
}

/* Shorthand */
<ELEMENT > {
  display: <value>;
}
```

The shorthand format is more popular, and it actually sets both outer and inner display type behind
the scenes. E.g., `display: block;` is the same as `display: block flow;` (`block` is outer, and
`flow` is inner). `flow` means that the children of this element will behave as defined by their
`display`.

The outer display type is either `block` or `inline`. Inner has much more options, like `flex`,
`grid`, `table`, `flow`, `flow-root`, and others.

Example: `display: flex` is really `display: block flex`. Some `<div style="display: flex;">`
would then be placed on a new line (like a `block`), but its children will follow the flexbox
principles.

### Block Display

Boxes are laid out one after the other in "vertical" direction (block direction really). The
"vertical" margins collapse.
By default, block elements consume all space in the "horizontal" (inline) direction.

:::caution
When I say "vertical", I really mean block direction. It's just easier to visualize concepts
with concrete direction. In this text and others on this site, I assume an English writing system
where text goes from left-to-right, and paragraphs appear from top to bottom.
:::

### Inline Display

Boxes are laid out "horizontally" (in inline direction really). Elements positioned inline are
placed within a _Line Box_ (which could be seen as a pseudo-element). Line Box is constrained
horizontally by container width and by floated elements. `line-height` is a height of a single Line
Box.

A text in HTML can be seen as a collection of elements (characters) which are inlined.

`text-align` and `vertical-align` behave a bit like flexbox properties.

### flow-root Display and BFC

It establishes a new Block Formatting Context (BFC). It means that its children cannot overflow and
go outside of it. `<html>` creates a BFC as well. Setting `overflow` (to anything other than
`visible` and `clip`) also does.

### Vertical and Hotizontal?

Looking at Block and Inline display as vertical and horizontal is an old way of looking at this
matter. We have to consider other writing systems where characters appear from right to left or even
vertically. With that in mind, the block and inline directions might vary.

We can set the writing mode with `writing-mode`, e.g. `writing-mode: vertical-lr`. "vertical" is the
inline direction and "lr" (left to right) is a block direction.

Using words such as "top", "bottom", "left" and "right" is problematic, because it makes our styles
fixed with some particular writing system (most often left-to-right). If we ever decide to add
support for another writing system we'll be a bit screwed, and we'll have to adjust a ton of styles.

To avoid such issues, there's alternative namings for varius directional properties:

- `left` - `inline-start`
- `right` - `inline-end`
- `top` - `block-start`
- `bottom` - `block-end`
- `width` - `inline-size`
- `height` - `block-size`

Example: `m, but its children will follow the flexbox principles.argin-right` becomes `margin-inline-end`.

### Formatting Context

Everything on a page is part of formatting context. The rooth `<html>` element establishes to
initial block formatting context.

There are many types of formatting context, like block, inline, flex.

### Block Formatting Context

Elements within a block formatting context are layed out according to Normal Flow.
Everything that is within the block formatting context needs to fit in that. So, if there is some
element that is [out of flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/In_flow_and_out_of_flow)
(like an absolutely positioned box or some floated box), it will be
within the closest block formatting context.

Block formatting context might be established in various ways, also "incidentally", like by setting
any non-default `overflow` property value. An explicit way to create a new block formatting context
is by setting `display: flow-root`. Its named this way, because creating a new block formatting
context is kind of like creating a new root (like `<html>` is one).

For example, if we have the following arrangement:

```html
<div style="background: green; width: 200px;">
  <div style="float: left; background: blue; width: 50px;">
    a float that goes below the parent
  </div>
  <div>Some loooooooooong text</div>
</div>
```

<div style="display: flow-root">
  <div style="background: green; width: 200px;">
    <div style="float: left; background: blue; width: 50px;">
      a float that goes below the parent
    </div>
    <div>Some loooooooooong text</div>
  </div>
</div>

The floated box goes out of its container. It's still within its closes block formatting context
(could be `<html>`).

We can fix it by making the container a new block formatting context:

```html
<div style="display: flow-root;">
  <div style="background: green; width: 200px; display: flow-root">
    <div style="float: left; background: blue; width: 50px;">
      a float that goes below the parent
    </div>
    <div>Some loooooooooong text</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<div style="background: green; width: 200px; display: flow-root; margin-bottom: 100px;">
  <div style="float: left; background: blue; width: 50px;">
    a float that goes below the parent
  </div>
  <div>Some loooooooooong text</div>
</div>

Now the floated box is contained completely within its container, because a BFC has to include all
of its children completely.

### Inline Formatting Context

Inline formatting context exists within other formattig context (opposed to BFC, which exists as
a root). In this context, horizontal padding, border and margin will be applied, pushing horizontal
content. However, vertical padding, border and margin will not push other Line Boxes away. So, for
example, a border would just be drawn on top of other Line Boxes:

```html
<p>
  This is placeholder text. It is used to fill a space in a design where the
  final content is not yet available. Using
  <span style="padding: 20px; border: 1px solid black;">placeholder</span> text
  allows designers and developers to see how the layout will look with text,
  without being distracted by the actual content. This makes it easier to focus
  on the visual aspects of the design, such as typography, spacing, and color.
</p>
```

<div style="background: grey;">
  <p>
    This is placeholder text. It is used to fill a space in a design where the
    final content is not yet available. Using
    <span style="padding: 20px; border: 1px solid black;">placeholder</span>
    text allows designers and developers to see how the layout will look with
    text, without being distracted by the actual content. This makes it easier
    to focus on the visual aspects of the design, such as typography, spacing,
    and color.
  </p>
</div>

---

Other formatting context (like flex) are not part of normal flow.

## Stacking Context

`z-index` is all about the order of painting of elements on the screen. There can be many _stacking
contexts_. Each positioned element creates a new stacking context. Different stacking contexts are
separated from one another and their `z-index` values do not compare. `z-index` values are compared
only within the same stacking context.

A new stacking context can also be created with the `isolation: isolate` property. It's kind of
similar to how a new BFC mightr be created "incidentally" by various CSS properties, but there's a
dedicated `display: flow-root` setting for creating a BFC. `isolation: isolate` has similar story.
"Incidental" stacking context might be created by setting `opacity`, or by setting `z-index` on
flex item, and in [many other ways](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Stacking_context#features_creating_stacking_contexts).

The root `<html>` element creates a first stacking context.
