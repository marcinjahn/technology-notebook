# HTML Foundations

When we author HTML documents, the main goal that we should have in mind is not the visual
representation of the result (that's the role of CSS), but rather the conveying of the meaning
of the content we are creating. First of all we have to think of the readers of the HTML we are
writing. These readers are called _User Agents_.

The User Agent acts on behalf of the user, and the HTML we author must be understandable for the
user agent in order for it to be able to present it to the user in the right way.
User agent might be for example:

- a web browser
- a screen reader (that's why accessibility really matters)
- search engine bot
- web scrapers
- LLMs (although these could be seen as web scrapers as well)

We might want to make our documents accessible to some user agents, and
as inaccessible as possible to others (like LLMs). That's a hard thing to do, because making
our document semantically rich will most likely improve the experience for all user agents types.
Therefore, for the aforementioned LLM case, we would probably go with a different approach, like
[Anubis](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis), which "weights the soul of incoming HTTP requests to
stop AI crawlers".

:::caution
I'm not necessarily against the usage of Large Language Models.
I just know about the impact of LLMs web scraping on some OSS projects
creating huge costs that free projects cannot withstand by definition.

Let's look at what **HTML** actually stands for:

- HT - HyperText - on of the features of HTML is cross-referencing between different documents.
- M - Markup - allows to enrich documents with meaning via various markup elements
- L - Language - it is a language, it has consistent vocabulary for its markup. It has a
  specification.

HTML is meant to be _semantic_ - which means that it has to do with meaning. Appropriate markup tags
help to give proper meaning to something. Semantics in HTML make it possible for different kinds of
user agents to process our documents in different ways. Browesr will make visual distinction between
different parts of documents, while screen reader will read content properly. LLMs will know what is
the actual content and what isn't.

## Specific Elements

This is just a few examples of HTML tips.

### Section vs. Article

A section is a generic grouping of some thematic content.
An article is some fragment that stands on its own.

It is not obvious in some cases if we should user a section or an article.
Possibly it's good to look at reusability. If the part we want to markup
is kind of unique on the page and will not repeat anywhere else, it might be a section.
Otherwise, it's more like an article.

Anyway, whichever one you choose, it's almost always a better choise than a `DIV`.
`DIV` is a last resort element.

### Forms

Every input in a form has its:

- `id` - for label to target it
- `name` - for submit to build proper properties list. Each property will take its name form this
  field. That's why radio buttons use the same name for every option - because the property name
  should be the same, just values are different.
