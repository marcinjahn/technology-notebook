# Index

Index is a data structure, which is separate from the heap, and it has pointers
to the heap. It contains part of our actual data, allowing us to search for
something. A single table might index one or more columns. Thanks to the index,
we might avoid the SCAN operation on the heap. So, index is like a list of
pointers to pages on the heap. When an [Index Scan](#index-scan) is performed,
the DB goes to the index, and then to the heap. The data from the heap (pages)
might contain more rows than the ones that satisfy our query. Therefore, the
retrieved pages need to be evaluated to discard the wrong rows.

Index is most popularly implemented as a B-Tree, although there are also other
data structures possible.

:::tip
Index itself is also stored in pages.
:::

Small index is better for performance, because such index might live in memory.

:::danger
Index speeds up reads, but slows down writes.
:::

_Primary key_ usually has an index created automatically for it. It also
usuablly becomes a clustered index. A clustered index is a special case of
indexing where the index is actually stored within the table itself. It's done
by making the table ordered with the primary index. So, anytime you want to use
the clusted index, you actually go directly into the table, since it's already
sorted by that index. Anytime you insert some data into the table, it gets
inserted in the right place for the clustered index to maintain the order.

:::tip[Postgres]
In Postgres, all indexes are secondary.
:::

Having an index does not mean that it will always be used in queries that
involve the indexed column. It really depends on the cost analysis that the
database planner prepares. Sometimes, it might be cheaper to actually go
directly to the table and scan. An example of that would be indexing a "Name"
column, and then invoking something like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE Name LIKE '%Something%'
```

In this case, the index would have to be scanned as a whole, and since we also
need other columns, it's probably more efficient to go to the table directly,
skipping the index data structure.

## Multiple Column Indexes

Index might contain data of other columns than the indexed one(s), and it might
help avoid going to the table when all
we need in the result are the columns that are part of that index
([Index Only Scan](#index-only-scan)). Here's how to create a multi-column index
in Postgres:

```sql
CREATE INDEX id_with_age_idx ON users(id) include (age)
```

We can also ceate a composed index that is built from multiple columns. We define
such indices from left to right, e.g.:

```sql
CRETE a_b_idx ON users(a, b)
```

Such an index will be useful when we have a condition on column a, or on both a and b (`a OR b` will
not work). It will not be useful when we have a condition just on b. In such case, the planner
will probably decide to just scan the table. This is because, the index is ordered by
a first, and only then by b.

:::tip
A single query might use multiple separate indices. E.g., when your
condition is on columns A and B, and you have two indices, one on A, and one on
B, DB planner might decide to scan them both in parallel, to build a single
bitmap and retrieve appropriate pages from the heap later on.

## Scans

## Index Scan

When we execute a query that includes some condition on an indexed column, and
the DB's analysis engine decides to use an index, there's going to be an Index
Scan. The DB will look into the index, and as soon as the value satisfies the
condition, it will go to the heap to acquire the appropriate page(s).

## Bitmap Index Scan

When the query may use the index, and we're looking for some condition that wil
potentially draw multiple rows (e.g., `SELECT * WHERE age > 30`, assuming that
`age` is indexed), a bitmap will be used to store the pages that we'll have to
look at. DB will not go into the heap per row. Instead, it will first scan the
index, collect the pages (in bitmap), and then collect all the pages it needs.

There could be queries that involve multiple indices. In such case, it'd build
two bitmaps. Then, it'd just AND them together, creating a single bitmap.

## Index Only Scan

When the query asks only for the data that is contained within the index, the DB
does not have to even go to the heap. It will just scan the index, and build the
response based on that. It's the fastest possible query kind.

:::caution
Index Only Scan does not guarantee that the DB engine will not read
any data from the disk. The index itself might be big enough that it'd not fin
in the memory. In such cases, there will be some disk I/O executed.
:::

## Sequential Table Scan

When index is not used for the query (e.g., when there's no index, or the query
would not benefit from indexing), the DB is going to scan the table for the
results. It's going to look at each row one by one. It's the worst kind of
query.

## Planner Heuristics

The existence of an index does not guarantee that it wil be used for the queries. Even when the
index is created on the column that we've included in our condition, in some cases it might be
"ignored". It could be that the planner incurrs that the result will probably require it to go and
fetch most of the pages anyway, so it will not even bother going to the index, expecially if it'd
require to load the index from the disk.
A similar case would be when we have very small amount of data. Any query would require the DB
engine to fetch the whole page, so it doesn't make sense to consult the index first.
