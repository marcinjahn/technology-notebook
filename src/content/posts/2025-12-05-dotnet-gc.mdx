In typical web development scenarios, developers do not have to take any special care about memory management.
It definitely makes it easier to program the process you're working on, but it might bite you in the back
when your application turns out to be popular. Increased load or growing amount of data being
processed will result in higher and higher memory usage, which translates directly to higher costs.
In today's environments with dynamic scaling it is definitely less of a problem than it used to be
in the past, but it does not nullify the issue. The additional resources still need to be paid for,
and problems will accumulate.

Therefore, I think it makese sense to have at least basic knowledge on what's going on behind the
scenes when you create that new object. It's worth to stop for a second and make sure that the way
you coded that new feature is actually optimal in terms of memory usage (just to be clear, sometimes
it doesn't matter at all, but often it actually does). Should you use a class or a struct? Does this
new field in you class have a big impact on overall memory usage or not really? Does that
odd pause in your API's processing that shows up in metrics from time to time is a sign of something
bad going on? I was wondering about these (and other) topics myself, and after a bit of research I
wrote the following:

- [Garbage Collection in general](/programming/core/garbage-collection)
- .NET:
  - [Overview of .NET Memory Management](/programming/dotnet/memory-management/memory-management)
  - [Garbage Collector Internals](/programming/dotnet/memory-management/gc-internals)
  - [GC Memory Layout & Allocation](/programming/dotnet/memory-management/gc-memory)
  - [GC Advanced Topics](/programming/dotnet/memory-management/gc-advanced)

Most of the information in the articles are based on the excellent [Pro .NET Memory Management](https://prodotnetmemory.com/) book. I highly recommend it if you find yourself interested in the topic.
My articles contain the bits that I found the most important for myself, with additions based on my
own experimentation and other sources.

Hope you find it useful!
