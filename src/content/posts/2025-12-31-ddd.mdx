I had an [article on DDD](/programming/architecture/ddd) since quite some time, but recently I took some time to revisit the topic
and update my summary on the Domain-Driven Design. I added much more details to clarify some of the
concepts.

To gain a full undersatnding of DDD, I highly recommend to read the books (starting from the blue
book) as well, since it's impossible to compress all the knowledge and rationale into a short
article. The books I recommend are linked to at the bottom of [my article](/programming/architecture/ddd).
