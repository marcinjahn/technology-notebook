# Directives

Directives are a way to kind of decorate HTML element with some additional
logic. Similarly to [Components](./components), they can be applied to
element using:

- attributes (most often used)
- classes
- element type
- id

For example, I could have this:

```html
<p appUnderline>Some paragraph</p>
```

It would apply the `UnderlineDirective` to the paragraph.

Directive is a TS class with a `@Directive` decorator applied to it.

There are also some built-in directives.

Directives can be:

- "casual" - do not add/remove elements from the DOM
- structural - add/remove elements from the DOM

## Built-in Directives

### ngStyle

It allows us to set styling of elements based on some condition:

```html
<p [ngStyle]="{ color: getColor() }">ABC</p>
```

The `getColor()` method would return some valid color string based on some
condition.

### ngClass

It's very similar to `ngStyle`, but it applies classes based on some logic.

```html
<p [ngClass]="{ highlighted: username === 'admin' }"
>
  {{username}}
</p>
```

The `.highlighted` CSS class will be applied to this paragraph only if it's an
admin.

### *ngIf

A conditional:

```html
<p *ngIf="userExists">Username is {{ username }}</p>

<!-- With else: -->
<p *ngIf="userExists; else noUser">Username is {{ username }}</p>
<ng-template #noUser>
    <p>User does not exist</p>
</ng-template>
```

The "else" syntax really sucks compared to Vue.js... It would be easier to use
another `*ngIf` with reversed condition.

#### *ngIf Behind the Scenes

Angular transforms the `*ngIf` into something like this:

```html
<ng-template [ngIf]="userExists">
  <p>Username is {{ username }}</p>
</ng-template>
```

This is the "raw" version of `ngIf`. It would actually work if we placed it in
an app.

:::tip[Star]
The star prefixing `ngIf` is an information that this directive is *structural*.
The star turns the element that the directive is applied to into a child of
`<ng-template>`.

**We can't have more than one structural directive on one element!**
:::

### ngSwitch

Similarly to `switch` in most programming languages, we have `ngSwitch`
directive in Angular. This one is a bit unique, because we use it as a
combination of a few directives.

```html
<div [ngSwitch]="someValue">
  <p *ngSwitchCase="1">It's 1</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="2">It's 2</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="3">It's 3</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCaseDefault>It's something else</p>
</div>
```

Only one case is displayed at a time.

### *ngFor

Iteration can be done with `*ngFor`:

```html
<p *ngFor="let text of texts">
  {{ text }}
</p>
```

We can also get the index of the iteration with:

```js
*ngFor="let text of texts; let i = index"
```

The `i` variable may be used within the loop now.

## Custom Directives

Some conventions:

- the file names for directive are usually in the format `{name}.directive.ts`.
- the `selector` is usually camelCase.

Here's a simple example:

```ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[appMyDirective]'
})
class MyDirective implements OnInit {
  
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private elementRef: ElementRef) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.renderer.setStyle(elementRef.nativeElement, 'color', 'blue');
  }
}
```

Usage:

```html
<p appMyDirective>Some text</p>
```

The background of the paragraph will be blue.

:::caution[Registration]
Our directive has to be registered in a module, just like any component that we
create. Similarly to components, we place the directives in the `declarations`
array.
:::

A few highlights:

- the `[appMyDirective]` selector is in square brackets, which means that the
  directive will be used as an attribute. If our selector was without the square
  brackets, it would be specifying an HTML element that this directive would be
  applied to (like `p`). If it has a dot at the beginning, it would select
  elements with a specified class.
- the `elementRef` in the constructor is the element that the directive was
  applied to. It gets injected into the instance automatically by Angular. The
  name can be whatever we want, just the type needs to be `ElementRef`.
- it's a good idea to use [Renderer2](./tips.md#renderer2).
- we can do something with our element. `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is a good
  place to do it.

:::tip[Angular CLI]
We can generate directives quickly with `ng g d <name>`.
:::

### Reacting to Events

Directives can listen to events on the elements they are attached to.
Here's an example:

```ts  {8}
@Directive({
  selector: '[appMyDirective]'
})
class MyDirective {
  
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private elementRef: ElementRef) { }

  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter(eventData) {
    // do something...
  }
}
```

### @HostBinding

There's an even easier way to modify DOM properties than using
[references](./tips.md#references-to-html-elements) or
[Renderer2](./tips.md#renderer2). It's a decorator called `HostBinding`. It
allows to bind to a specified property on the DOM element to access it easily.

Here's an example:

```ts {6,11}
@Directive({
  selector: '[appMyDirective]'
})
class MyDirective implements OnInit {

  @HostBinding('style.color') elColor: string;
  
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private elementRef: ElementRef) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.elColor = 'white';
  }
}
```

Another example shows how we can toggle a class on some element:

```ts
@HostBinding('class.open') isOpen = false;
```

Setting `isOpen` to `true` adds the class `open` to the element.

:::tip[Renderer2]
There's nothing wrong with using [Renderer2](./tips.md#renderer2). It's just
another convenient way to access the DOM.
:::

### Directive's Inputs

Our directives can support some input arguments, very similarly to the way how
[Components](./components) accept inputs. This way, users of the directive can
have some influence on how it works.

Here's an example:

```ts {6,12}
@Directive({
  selector: '[appMyDirective]'
})
class MyDirective implements OnInit {

  @Input() color: string; // it could have some default value if it's not provided
  @HostBinding('style.color') elColor: string;
  
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private elementRef: ElementRef) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.elColor = this.color;
  }
}
```

This is a silightly modified code compared to the previous example. Now the
color applied to our element is no longer hardcoded. Here's how the binding is
done in the template:

```html
<p appMyDirective [color]="'blue'">Some text</p>
```

Angular figures out if the provided input belongs to the directive or the
element itself. (What if there's a conflict?)

#### Reusing directive's name for an input

Some built-in directives, such as `[ngClass]` accept the inut (a class name)
directly under the directive's name, like this:

```html
<p [ngClass]="{ highlighted: username === 'admin' }">{{Username}}</p>
```

We can do it as well in our directives:

```ts {6}
@Directive({
  selector: '[appMyDirective]'
})
class MyDirective {

  @Input('appMyDirective') color: string;

  // ...
}
```

We'd use that directive as follows:

```html
<p [appMyDirective]="'blue'">Some text</p>
```
The `appMyDirective` has two meanings now:

- it's an attribute which marks DOM elements that we want to apply our directive
  to;
- it's an inut of our directive allowing users to set some value.

Angular allows us to use the shorthand of including the `appMyDirective` in
square brackets to communicate to the framework both of the meanings listed
above.

:::tip[Other Inputs]
We can use the technique described above together with other inputs that have
their own individual names.
:::

---

:::tip[@Output]
Other than `@Input`s, directives can also have `@Output`s. That makes them even
more similar to [Components](./components).
:::

### Custom Structural Directives

As it was described in the [*ngIf section](#ngif), structural components have a
star prefixing the directive's name. That causes the elements to be placed in
`<ng-template>`, which is Angular's way to specify templates.

Here's an example of how to build our own structural components. This is an
imlementation of `*ifNot`:

```ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[ifNot]'
})
class IfNotDirective {

  @Input() set ifNot(condition: bool) {
    if (!condition) {
      this.vsRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef); // display content
    } else {
      this.vcRef.clear(); // remove content
    }
  }

  constructor(private templateRef: TemplateRef<any>, private vcRef: ViewContainerRef) { }
}
```

We'd use it like this:

```html
<p [*ifNot]="userFound">User not found</p>
```

In the directive's class we used the following (auto-injected) elements:

- `TemplateRef<any>` - this represents the `<ng-template>` that is generated due to a '*'
- `ViewContainerRef` - this represents the place where the element (that our
  directive is applied to) should be located.

Basically, `TemplateRef<any>` represents the *WHAT*, and the `ViewContainerRef`
represents the *WHERE*, helping our directive to do its job.
